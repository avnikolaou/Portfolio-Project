# Portfolio-Project

The Portfolio Project is the second project of the Udacity Front End Nanodegree Progam. A design mockup was provided and the goal was to replicate that design in HTML and CSS. The result is a responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to some of the portfolio projects completed throughout the course of the Nanodegree program.
